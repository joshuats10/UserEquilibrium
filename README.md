# Programming Assignemt of User Equilibrium
Here is my programming assignment to solve static user equilibrium for Transport Systems Analysis Class given at 8 December 2020, submitted at 5 January 2021.
Instead of only solving the user equilibrium problem, I also has incorporated a diagram that can visualised the equilibrium solution.
